	select HID
	help
	  THC (Touch Host Controller) is the name of the IP block in PCH that
	  interface with Touch Devices (ex: touchscreen, touchpad etc.). It
	  is comprised of 3 key functional blocks: A natively half-duplex
	  Quad I/O capable SPI master; A low latency I2C interface to support
	  HIDI2C compliant devices; A HW sequencer with RW DMA capability to
	  system memory.

	  Say Y/M here if you want to support Intel THC. If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Intel QuickSPI, base on Touch Host Controller (THC), implements
	  HIDSPI (HID over SPI) protocol. It configures THC to work at SPI
	  mode, and controls THC HW sequencer to accelerate HIDSPI transcation
	  flow.

	  Say Y/M here if you want to support Intel QuickSPI. If unsure, say N.
